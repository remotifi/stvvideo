Remotifi.JS Smart TV Alliance application demo

## Overview

This sample application, built for the Smart TV Alliance platform, demonstrates how to embed Remotifi.JS session support in a DIAL application. 

The [Remotifi.JS SDK](http://www.remotifi.com) enables websites to discover and control devices such as Smart TVs and streaming sticks via a JavaScript API. 

Using the SDK, websites may launch, stop and query DIAL applications if they're installed on a DIAL enabled device. Furthermore, by adding session support to a DIAL application, websites can utilize the SDK to load media, control playback and subscribe to media status updates.

See the [Implementing session support in DIAL applications](http://www.remotifi.com/docs/guide/dial) tutorial for a detailed walkthrough of how to enable DIAL applications to be controlled via Remotifi.JS.
